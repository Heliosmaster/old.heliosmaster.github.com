Hi. I am [Davide "Helios" Taviani](http://davidetaviani.com).

I've had a blog since 2005, more or less. During all these years of using Wordpress (mostly) I grow tired of the unnecessary structure: database? themes? plugins? users & permissions? meh. However, the prospect of writing custom static html pages by hand each time I want to post something, was not exactly an appealing alternative. And then [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

### Tech stuff ###

The theme is based on [Tom Ward's blog](https://github.com/tomafro/tomafro.net) after the necessary tinkering.

The icons up there are from the [Social Network Icon Pack by Rogie King](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/social-network-icon-pack/), except the Github icon, which is from [Burin Asavesna's blog](http://helloburin.com/2010/09/20/github-social-icon/).
