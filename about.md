## About me ##
Hi, I am Davide, a mathematics student at Utrecht University and hopeless geek.

I haven't done much [until now](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/958311/cv_Davide.pdf), and I much more excited for what has yet to come.

I also have a italian website, [Andvari](http://www.andvari.it).

## About this blog ##

Sometimes I blog in [english]({{site.url}}/archives_en/) (especially If I want to share something more technical), and sometime I _rant_ in [italian]({{site.url}}/archives_it/).

Before February 2012 (roughly), I used to write everything (in italian) on another blog, [Il Sognatore di Nuvole](http://blog.andvari.it).

The theme is based on [Tom Ward's blog](https://github.com/tomafro/tomafro.net) after the necessary tinkering.

The icons up there are from the [Social Network Icon Pack by Rogie King](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/social-network-icon-pack/), except the Github icon, which is from [Burin Asavesna's blog](http://helloburin.com/2010/09/20/github-social-icon/).
