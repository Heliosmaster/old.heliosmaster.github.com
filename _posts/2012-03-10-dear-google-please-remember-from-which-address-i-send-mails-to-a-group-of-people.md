Dear Google, my name is Davide and I am a student at Universiteit Utrecht, so I have a mail "@students.uu.nl", which is from [Google Apps Education edition](http://www.google.com/apps/intl/it/edu/), but that does not matter for my story. Neither is the fact that it is a mail for the university, because the same exact reasoning can be applied to any company email, whether is essentially Google Mail or not.

You see, I take advance of one of the awesome feature that your mail provides: this university address is set, along with others that I employ very rarely, in my primary gmail address; doing so, I am able to send a email from the same account as all the others, secondary emails.

When I send a email to a professor or any other member of the university (whose email addresses end with @uu.nl), or any other fellow student (again @students.uu.nl) it is rather reasonable that I send that email using the official account; in some cases, that is mandatory (in my previous university, in Ferrara, they threatened to discard mails not from the university account).

Of course I can do it manually, but wouldn't it be awesome, if you _remembered_? Or that I could set a "filter" (call it as you want), something like "all mails to *@uu.nl should have this address as default"?

Usually I try to pay as much attention as I can, but, you know, I am more focused on the content of the mail itself rather than on the sending address; more than once I forgot about this tiny detail, and I was lucky that did not matter much.

The problem in my case is worsened by the fact that my primary email address (which actually was the first one that I ever had) was created in my early adolescence, and I slightly regret my choice of nickname: sending a official mail as _helios_ + my year of birth + @gmail.com is surely less than desirable (I will change it, eventually, to something @ this domain).

I am sure my problem is not isolated: certainly there are some companies that require that all the internal communication is done using that address, even governments! (in Italy, all the communications between a person and offices must be done via an address that they supply, claimed to be "certified").

I cannot see how this little tweak would drastically change your platform, since you already do something similar: when I receive a mail to my student address and I reply, the default choice is correct!

I know that this may sound a little trivial, but still it could help giving the feeling of refinement that attracts, and pleases, lots of people (see Apple).

Your loyal customer, and friend, Davide.
