you are a reserved thinker

<!--more-->

<strong>About you: </strong><em>you are a thinker</em>

Your cautiousness, appreciation of functionality, and imagination combine to make you a THINKER.

You have a vivid capacity for imagery that allows you to see beyond your present circumstances.

You like to be sure of yourself before voicing your opinion.

A lot of your time is spent at home, or with the people you care about.

Although you may dream often, you're very aware of how things work, and you value things that work well.

You take comfort in the familiar, and value predictability—and others value those things in you.

Accordingly, you prefer a set routine, and although you often imagine how things can be different, you're hesitant to take risks to change things.

Sometimes you doubt whether you have the ability to face certain challenges, but your practical focus helps you solve most problems.

Because of this, you tend to be more reactive than proactive, thinking thoroughly about the challenges that you face.

You have a broad-based, theoretical understanding of the world that allows you to understand its workings.

You're not one to force your positions on a group, and you tend to be fair in evaluating different options.

You prefer to have time to plan for things, feeling better with a schedule than with keeping plans up in the air until the last minute.

You do your own thing when it comes to clothing, guided more by practical concerns than by other people's notions of style.

<em> if you want to be different</em> :

Try indulging your imagination a bit more by experiencing new and different things.

Have a little more faith in your capacity to do things—turn your thoughts into actions!

<strong>How you relate to others: </strong><em>you are reserved</em>

You are RESERVED – you aren't someone who always needs to have others around,  		and you find you can handle most situations on your own.

You can be very happy spending time alone, and enjoy your own thoughts and  		ideas.

You find it difficult to understand why some people get so emotional and  		tell everyone else their problems.

You believe that if you want to get something done, it is best to do it  		yourself.

In your experience, other people are not always completely dependable, so you  		generally rely on yourself and only a few close others.

Despite your independence, you are not a closed-minded person who makes hasty judgments about others. You  		know that it isn't always easy to walk in other people's shoes.

At times other people's feelings are puzzling to you, and you wish that people  		were more rational.

Your vision of the world is complex – your values are not set in stone.  		Instead, you are able to change your beliefs as you learn new information.

<em> if you want to be different:</em>

Even though it is tiring, making an extra effort to spend time with others even  		when you feel like being alone can have powerful positive effects on your  		relationships.

Practice talking about yourself to people you haven't previously trusted. You  		will forge friendships where you wouldn't have thought possible, and with  		practice, sharing your thoughts and feelings will get easier and easier.
