Tell me which road,
Which road are you travelling,
Which road are you travelling on.
Tell me who will you turn to when the light,
when the light is gone.
'said I hear somebody calling,
'said I hear somebody calling to me.

<!--more-->
With so many roads to travel,
There's just one can set you free.
'said there's just one road,
One road to freedom.
'said there's just one road,
One road to freedom.
There's just one.
There's just one.

In my life, in my life I have been blessed.
In my life I have been cursed.
I have lived the best of times.
I have suffered, I have suffered the worst.
Do you know which road you're travelling.
Do you know where you want to be.

With so many roads to travel.
There's just one can set you free.
'said there's just one road,
One road to freedom.
'said there's just one road,
One road to freedom.
'said there's just one road,
One road to freedom.
There's just one.
There's just one.
There's just one.
There's just one.
