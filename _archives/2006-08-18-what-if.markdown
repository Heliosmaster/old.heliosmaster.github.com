E alla fine le tenebre si trasformano sempre in luce. ogni giorno...

<blockquote>What if there was no light
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time
And no reason, or rhyme
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

Oooooooh that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooooh that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try
Oooooooh that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life
That you don't want me there by your side

Oooooooh thats right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooooh that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try
Oooooooh that's right

Oooooooh thats right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooooh that's right
You know that darkness always turns into light
Oooooooh that's right</blockquote>
