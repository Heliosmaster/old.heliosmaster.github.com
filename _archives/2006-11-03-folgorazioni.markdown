Last.fm Ã¨ fenomenale. Pochi secondi dopo il post precedente mi ha sparato questa bellissima canzone:

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete
Oh simple thing where have you gone
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me?
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Oh simple thing where have you gone
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?</span></span>
