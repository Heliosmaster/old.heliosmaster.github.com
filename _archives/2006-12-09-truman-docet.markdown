Solo un brivido, e cogli che la realtà è un'altra. Un battito di ciglia e il bianco è nero e il nero è bianco. Un battito di cuore e la gioia si tramuta in odio. E tutto quello che rimane è...nulla.

<blockquote>You'll rescue me right?

In the exact same way they never did..

I'll be happy right?

When your healing powers kick in

You'll complete me right?

Then my life can finally begin

I'll be worthy right?

Only when you realize the gem I am?

But this won't work now the way it once did

And I won't keep it up even though I would love to

Once I know who I'm not then I'll know who I am

But I know I won't keep on playing the victim

These precious illusions in my head did not let me down

When I was defenseless

And parting with them is like parting with invisible best friends

This ring will help me yet as will you knight in shining armor

This pill will help me yet as will these boys gone through like water

But this won't work as well as the way it once did

Cuz I want to decide between survival and bliss

And though I know who I'm not I still don't know who I am

But I know I won't keep on playing the victim

These precious illusions in my head did not let me down when I was a kid

And parting with them is like parting with a childhood best friend

I've spent so long firmly looking outside me

I've spent so much time living in survival mode

This won't work now the way it once did

Cuz I want to deside between servival and bliss

Now I know who I'm not

I don't I still don't know who I am

But I know I won't keep on playing the victom

These precious illusions in my head did not let me down

When I was defenseless

And parting with them is like parting with invisible best friends

These precious illusions in my head did not let me down

When I was a kid

And parting with them is like parting with childhood best friends
