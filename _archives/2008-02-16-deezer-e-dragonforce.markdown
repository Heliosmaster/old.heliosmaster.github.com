Sarà che ho la febbre quasi a 39°C e che i miei deliri sono fuori di testa (dopotutto sono deliri, no?) ma mi sono dato all'ascolto di "<a href="http://www.deezer.com/it/#music/result/through%20fire%20and%20flames">Through fire and flames</a>" dei <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonForce">DragonForce</a>, una band speed power metal britannica.

Nel linkare la canzone ho anche introdotto un nuovo sito internet (nuovo per me, <em>as usual</em>) che permette di ascoltare gratis online molte e molte canzoni (non ho provato quanto sia grande il database, ma ad esempio contiene tutte le canzoni dei <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigur_Rós" title="Sigur Rós">Sigur Rós</a> .

Dateci un'occhiata, ne vale sicuramente la pena!

<strong>Through fire and flames</strong>
<blockquote><small> On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light,
In flames of death's eternal reign, we ride towards the fight.
When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right.
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight.</small>

<small>Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore,
The scattered souls will feel the hell, bodies wasted on the shore.
On the blackest plains in Hell's domain, we watch them as they go,
Through fire and pain, and once again we know...</small>

<small>So now we're flying we're free, we're free before the thunderstorm,
On towards the wilderness, our quest carries on.
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight,
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls...</small>

<small>So far away we wait for the day,
For the lives all so wasted and gone;
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days-
Through the fire and the flames we carry on!</small>

<small>[Small interlude]</small>

<small>As the red day is dawning, and the lightning cracks the sky,
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above with resentment in their eyes.
Running back through the midmorning light, there's a burning in my heart;
We're banished from a time in a fallen land, to a life beyond the stars.</small>

<small>In your darkest dreams see to believe, our destiny is time,
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight...!</small>

<small>And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality;
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone.
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind,
Day after day this misery must go on!</small>

<small>So far away we wait for the day,
For the lives all so wasted and gone,
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,
Through the fire and the flames we carry on!</small>

<small>[Big interlude]</small>

<small>Now here we stand with their blood on our hands,
We fought so hard now can we understand
Ill break the seal of this curse if i possibly can
For freedom of every man!</small>

<small>So far away we wait for the day,
For the lives all so wasted and gone,
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,
Through the fire and the flames we carry on!</small></blockquote>
