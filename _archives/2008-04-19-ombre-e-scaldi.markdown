Stasera, non so perché, sono fissato con <a href="http://www.deezer.com/track/22959">questa canzone</a> dei mitici Blind. Martedì la seconda simulazione della terza prova e voglia di studiare sotto zero. Dove finirò?

<blockquote>Would you believe in a night like this
A night like this, when visions come true
Would you believe in a tale like this
A lay of bliss, a praise in the old lore
Come to the blazing fire and

See me in the shadows
See me in the shadows
Songs I will sing
Of runes and rings
Just hand me my harp
This night turns into myth
Nothing seems real
But you soon will feel
The world we live in is another skald
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows

Do you believe there is sense in it
Is it true for myth
There one in my ryhmes
Nobody knows the meaning behind
The weaver's line
Well nobody else but the Nords can
See through the blazing fires of time and
All things will procede as the child of the hallowed
We'll speak to you now

See me in the shadows
See me in the shadows
Songs I will sing of tribes and kings
The carrion bird and the hall of the slain
Nothing seems real
You soon will feel
The world we live in is another skalds
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows

Do not fear for my reason
There's nothing to hide
How bitter your treason
How bitter the lie
Remember the runes and remember the light
All I ever want is to be at your side
We'll gladden the raven now I will
Run through the blazing fires
That's my choice
Cause things shall procede as foreseen</blockquote>
