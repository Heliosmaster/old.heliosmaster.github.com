Questa canzone dei Manowar è fantastica, a dispetto di tutti coloro che ritengono che i "vecchi" Manowar erano meglio. Ora, io non sono intenditore ma da cultore e amante della mitologia nordica o norrena che dir si voglia , non posso fare a meno di apprezzare questa bellissima canzone. E poi dà carica :lol:

Ah giocare a WoW con questa in sottofondo rende un sacco.

<blockquote>Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I ponder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smashed

Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end...

One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land

Glory and fame!
Blood is our name..
Soul full of thunder!!
Hearts of steel
Killers of men!
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

Sons of the gods
today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War

[Solo]

Sons of Odin we four..!!
By the hammer of Thor!
Ride down from the sky....
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die!!!!

Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War

Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War

Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail
Gods
of War!!!

...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day

Hail Gods Of War!!!!!</blockquote>
