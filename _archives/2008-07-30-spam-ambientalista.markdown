Oggi ho ricevuto questo messaggio su Flickr:
<blockquote>It breaks my heart to see this terrible degradation. But worse it will join the filth in the great pacific. There it will build on the awful pile that is already there and cause the death of fish and other ocean creatures.

I don't think there is anything we humans can really do to stop the climate change but we sure as hell can clean up our mess.

Did you know that in the 1950's there were over a million lions in sub-Sahara Africa and today there are only about 25K. I don't know which is going to go extinct first Polar Bars, Lions or Rhino's.

Visit the earth while  you can it is changing very very fast.

Have you seen the pix of Bejing you can reach out and touch the air.
in the 1950's Los Angeles looked like that. Today we have very few days that the air is so bad you can't go out. We are trying to take care of our little part of the earth. There isn't a single community that doesn't recycle and dispose of our green waist. In fact there is a place we can go to get free compost made from the city green waste.

Thanks for caring, Julie</blockquote>
Mah, capisco la preoccupazione per l'ambiente..ma in sé questo messaggio non ha un gran senso, non è un bel discorso. Se non altro ponendoti la domanda "cos'avrà voluto dire?" rifletti un po' sull'ambiente.

Ma tant'è.

Mah, <em>stranezze</em>.
