You <a href="http://www.joe-ks.com/archives_mar2001/Psych_Test.htm">GOT</a> a score of 39 out of 64
<blockquote>Your rating: Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful &amp; practical. They see you as clever, gifted or talented, but modest... Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken.</blockquote>
